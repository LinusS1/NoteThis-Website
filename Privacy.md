## Privacy
We take privacy very seriously. Actually, we don't want your data.

There are no anayltics in our apps, and nothing is ever sent to us -- It's how apps _should_ be built: no creepy tracking whatsoever.
For this reason, no data is ever sent to our servers. All data is stored with Apple, either on you device, or in iCloud, if you choose to enable syncing.

### Beta
If you are enrolled in our beta, additional information is sent to Apple. If you choose, crash logs, and other metrics are sent to Apple. Additional feedback you send is sent to Apple. We are able to view the data and screenshots you send.
The data will be deleted within 30 days, or sooner if deemed necessary.
